Partnered with criminal psychologist Evelyn Cross, who recognizes Jack's emotional turmoil, he delves into the investigation. Uncovering a series of cryptic symbols and facing resistance from his superiors, particularly Chief of Police Victor Kane, Jack's pursuit of truth intensifies.

Kane's warnings and veiled threats deepen Jack's suspicion.
